0.9.1
  * Fixed Key binding functionality with Num Lock turned on
  * Added "Unpack" Plugin that unpacks an archive into a temp directory. Once
    you leave that directory, the plugin asks if you want to rebuild the
    package. This approximates the "archives as directories" feature that many
    people have asked for.
  * Added a special menu for executable files with options:  "Execute",
    "Execute with args", "Execute in xterm" and "Execute in xterm with args".

  * Added up/down buttons to pages in the config dialogs (you can still drag &
    drop, but buttons are more obvious)

    execute that action.

    operations, or custom commands similair to "User Commands"

    directory field
  * Added "Auto Refresh" capability.. you can disable it if you want
  * Added "Sort By Ext." function to the special function menu
  * Now you can drag and drop between different instances of emelFM and some
    other Gtk+ Filemanagers like gmc.
  * Right Clicking the "Up Dir" button will now change to the Home directory
  * Modified the Right-click menu to include the "User" and "Special" submenus.
    "Properties" and "Operations" are also submenus by default now.. to have
    them expanded check "Expanded Right-Click menu" from General - Page 2 of
    the config dialog.
  * Now you can navigate the filelist using Vi style keys (hjkl). Select "Use
    Vi Keys" from General - Page 2 of the config dialog.

    execute a command on each selected file instead of passing all of the
    selected filename's to one command

    click.

    Solaris 2.5. Thanks!
  * Added sort arrows to the column buttons
  * Prefixing an action for a filetype with an 'x' will open an xterm to execute
    that action just as it does for the command line. This just saves you from
    typing 'xterm -e sh -c "action"'. This also works for user commands,
    toolbar buttons, and just about anywhere else you can type a command.
  * Added Ctrl+W shortcut to open and close the output window

0.6.3
  * Added a user-defined commands menu which is activated with Ctrl+Right Click.
    I feel this is a better option than user-defined buttons (esp. since it
    means i don't have to go muck around with the button code :)
  * Now the macros for Filetype actions are the same as those for user commands.
    eg. %D = the inactive directory etc.. This allows you to add an action to
    untar a tarball into the inactive directory (let me know if you have any
    other uses for this).
  * Changed the way the confirmation dialogs work internally so that they now
    work with drag and drop also.
  * Removed the "Browse" menu option. I couldn't think of anything that would
    make it useful and I eventually forgot that it was even there so..
  * Fixed problem that was causing a compile-time error on Solaris 2.6.
    Thanks Maksim.

    problem that wouldn't let you copy to a dir if it was the last entry in
    the list

0.6.2
  * Fixed lots of crashes
  * Added Drag and Drop capabilities. Drag and Drop is initiated with the 
    middle mouse button. When you release the button, a menu will popup asking
    what operation (copy/move/symlink) you want to perform.
  * Added a special function menu which is activated with Shift+Right Click.
    The menu includes Glob operations and some other convenience functions.
  * Prefixing an 'x' to a command on the command line will open an xterm to
    execute the rest of the command. For example 'x man fopen' will open an
    xterm with the manpage for fopen.
  * Typing a 'cd' command now changes the current directory
  * Status bar now shows number of files selected/total files
